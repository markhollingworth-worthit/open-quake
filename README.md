An open driver and touchscreen launcher for the **DK-QUAKE / ARIS-68** — the
1920×480 touchscreen-plus-knob macro device (sold with the closed-source
DK-Suite app). `open-quake` talks to it directly over HID, with no vendor
software running.

*From top: the grid launcher · a merged-tile Media grid · the flip-clock app · a [Windy](https://www.windy.com) weather map and a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) dashboard — each with the knob's RGB ring lit a different color.*

> **Switching pages:** the panel shows one page at a time — **double-click the knob** to open the page selector, rotate to highlight a page, then press to switch. open-quake shows this tip right on the panel the first time you launch it.

It gives you:

- **A multi-grid launcher** — each page is a grid of tiles; tap a tile — or click it
  with your PC mouse — to open an app, URL, shell command, file, a system action
  (lock screen), or jump to another open-quake page. Icons can be an emoji, the
  program's own icon, or a custom image. → [Editor](docs/editor.md)
- **Web dashboard pages** — a page can be a live web view (Home Assistant, Grafana,
  a status page…) shown full-screen; the knob scrolls, a tap clicks, logins persist,
  with per-page auth (HA token, Basic, custom headers). → [Dashboards](docs/dashboards.md)
- **Knob control** — rotate for volume (or dashboard scroll), single-click to mute,
  **double-click for the page selector**, and **hold to talk** (voice input). The
  knob's **RGB ring** is configurable. → [Settings](docs/settings.md)
- **Bundled apps** — a Flip Clock, a **[Music controller](docs/music.md)** (now-playing +
  transport + app grid), a **[System Monitor](docs/system-monitor.md)** (live
  CPU/GPU/RAM/disk/network/battery), and an **[Open WebUI chat](docs/ai-chat.md)** you can
  **talk to by holding the knob**. → [Apps](docs/apps.md)
- **A PC-side editor** — build pages of tiles, merge adjacent tiles into larger buttons,
  drag-and-drop to rearrange, then **Save** to push to the panel. → [Editor](docs/editor.md)
- **Settings** — choose how it launches, **auto-rotate** through pages on a timer, toggle
  the mic, and tune the knob ring; plus a system-tray menu of quick toggles. → [Settings](docs/settings.md)

> **Status:** early but capable. Touch, knob (incl. RGB ring + hold-to-talk), grids, merged
> buttons, web dashboards, the bundled apps (clock / music / system monitor / AI chat), the
> on-board mic, and the editor are working and validated against real hardware. The panel is
> driven as a normal external monitor (Windows sees a 480×1920 / 1920×480 display); pushing
> frames over the HID resource channel is not implemented.

## 📖 Documentation

Detailed guides live in **[docs/](docs/README.md)**:

- [The editor](docs/editor.md) · [Web dashboards](docs/dashboards.md) · [Bundled apps](docs/apps.md)
- [Music controller](docs/music.md) · [System monitor](docs/system-monitor.md) · [Open WebUI chat + voice](docs/ai-chat.md)
- [Settings & knob lighting](docs/settings.md) · [Building & how it works](docs/building.md) · [Device protocol](docs/DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md)

## Download

Grab a build from the **[Releases](https://github.com/TeeJS/open-quake/releases)** page (Windows x64):
- **`open-quake-<version>-portable.exe`** — run directly, no install.
- **`open-quake-<version>-setup.exe`** — installer (Start-menu shortcut + uninstaller).

The exe is **code-signed** (Azure Trusted Signing, publisher *Thomas Schmitz*) — so you see a
verified publisher, not "Unknown publisher." Windows SmartScreen may still show a **"Windows
protected your PC"** prompt on first download; that's reputation-based (it eases as a release
gains downloads), not a problem with the file. Confirm the publisher reads **Thomas Schmitz**,
then click **More info → Run anyway**. Plug in the DK-QUAKE, then launch; config is stored in
`%APPDATA%\open-quake`. (Linux/macOS builds would need platform-specific launch/volume work —
not done yet.)

## Licensing

Split-licensed — see **[NOTICE](NOTICE)**:

- **MIT** ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) — the launcher and editor (`app/`), original work.
- **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** ([src/LICENSE](src/LICENSE)) — every file that
  embeds the reverse-engineered protocol: the driver (`src/Aris68Connector.js`),
  the protocol notes (`docs/DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md`), and the two `tools/` scripts.
  The vendor described the comm protocol as restricted for commercial use; these
  files are **non-commercial only** unless you obtain written commercial
  permission from the protocol holders.

No vendor code, binaries, or API keys are included in this repository.

## Safety

`Aris68Connector.js` knows the firmware-download (DFU) command but never sends
it. **Do not call `enterDfu()`** — it puts the device into firmware-flash mode
and can brick it. The write-test in `tools/` only issues read-only query frames.
