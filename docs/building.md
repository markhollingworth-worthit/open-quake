# Building & how it works

## How the hardware works

The DK-QUAKE's screen is a standard external monitor (HDMI or USB-C DisplayPort
alt-mode) recognized by Windows as a 480×1920 portrait display. A separate USB
link handles touch and control/knob/mic interfaces. Video travels over the
display cable; open-quake renders an Electron window onto that monitor, exactly
as DK-Suite did. Unplug the display cable and the panel goes dark, but the USB
side keeps working.

The USB side is two HID interfaces: a control interface (knob, mic/state,
firmware, keep-alive) and a multi-touch interface. The panel ships dark and
idle-blanks; the driver wakes it and sends a periodic keep-alive so it stays on.
The on-board mic enumerates as a standard **"5- USB PnP Audio Device"** — any app
can read it directly; `open-quake` doesn't wrap it.

Full reverse-engineered protocol: [DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md](DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md).

## Build & run (Windows)

> **Use a Node LTS — 20, 22, or 24** (built and verified on **24**). **Don't use Node 25/26.**
> The native-rebuild toolchain (`@electron/rebuild`) bundles an older `yargs` that won't load
> under Node 25/26 — `npm run rebuild` dies with *"ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES
> module scope."* If you hit that, `node --version`, switch to an LTS, delete `node_modules`, and
> reinstall. (`package.json` declares `"engines": node >=18 <25`; an `.nvmrc` pins 24.)

The app's one compiled native module, **`node-hid`**, must be built for this app's
Electron ABI (**Electron 42**), *not* your host Node. (`@jitsi/robotjs` ships
ABI-stable **N-API** prebuilds, so it needs no rebuild.) A plain `npm install` tries
to build natives against your host Node and can fail, so install without scripts,
fetch the Electron binary, then rebuild `node-hid` against Electron 42:

```powershell
npm install --ignore-scripts            # packages on disk, no native build
node node_modules/electron/install.js   # fetch the Electron 42 binary
npm run rebuild                          # electron-rebuild -v 42.4.1 -f --only node-hid
npm start
```

> If `npm install` fails with `EBUSY … electron.exe`, a copy of the app is still
> running — close it first, then retry.

Building the natives on modern Windows needs Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
(Desktop C++ workload) and a Python with `distutils` (`pip install
"setuptools<81"` on Python 3.12+). Set `GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2022` if node-gyp picks
the wrong toolset.

Plug in the DK-QUAKE before `npm start`. The launcher finds the panel display,
places a borderless window on it, wakes the backlight, and starts listening for
touch and knob input.

Set the DK-QUAKE's **display orientation to Landscape** in Windows (Settings →
System → Display) so Windows treats it as a 1920×480 landscape display — that
keeps the mouse and touch aligned with what you see. open-quake auto-rotates its
render if you leave it portrait, but then a desktop mouse moved onto the panel
reads 90° off.

If your taps land on the **wrong monitor** (Windows binds touch to the primary
display by default for any HID touchscreen that doesn't include the proper
Container ID in its USB descriptor — which most generic HDMI touchscreens don't),
open the editor → **Settings → Hardware → Set up touchscreen**. That launches
Windows' built-in `multidigimon -touch` wizard, the same backend tool Tablet PC
Settings → Setup → Touch Input used to fire before Microsoft broke that UI in
Win 11 24H2.

**How to drive the wizard:** Accept the UAC prompt. The wizard shows
*"Tap this screen with a single finger to identify it as a touch screen — if
this is not the touch screen, press Enter to move to the next screen"* on each
display in sequence, starting with your primary. **Press Enter on your keyboard
to skip past every monitor that isn't the panel.** Only when the prompt window
appears on the 480-tall panel itself do you tap the panel with your finger.
That writes a persistent override under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wisp\Pen\Digimon` that survives reboot, sleep, USB
reconnect, and primary-display swaps.

**Clear all calibrations** is only for fixing stale `tabcal` coordinate
calibration (taps land on the right display but slightly off). You don't
normally need it for initial binding — `Set up touchscreen` alone is sufficient.
