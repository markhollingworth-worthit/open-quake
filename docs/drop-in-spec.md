# Drop-in apps — integration specification

**Audience:** maintainers of open-quake forks (or compatible launchers) who want to support
**drop-in apps** — self-contained app folders a user installs at runtime without rebuilding.

**Spec version:** 1 · **Reference implementation:** open-quake ≥ 0.3.0.

This document is normative for the **package format** and the **runtime/security contract**: an
app authored against this spec MUST run unmodified on any conforming host, and a host MUST NOT
weaken the security rules in §6. The §7 manager and §9 file map describe *how* the reference
implementation does it — adapt those freely as long as §2–§6 hold.

Keywords **MUST / SHOULD / MAY** are used in the RFC 2119 sense.

---

## 1. Concept and invariants

A drop-in app is a folder containing a **manifest** (`app.json` or `manifest.json`) plus its
web assets. The host discovers it, lists it in the editor, and renders it full-screen on the
panel as an app page. Two delivery modes exist: **static** (`file://`) and **served** (a local
loopback HTTP server).

Design invariants a conforming host MUST preserve:

1. **Update-safe storage.** Drop-in apps live in a per-user data folder, never in the install
   directory, so updating the host never deletes them (§3).
2. **Path containment.** An app can only read/serve files inside its own folder (§6.1).
3. **Informed consent for host code.** Installing an app that can run code on the host
   (a server module or bundled executables) MUST warn the user first (§6.3).
4. **Loopback isolation.** The served-app HTTP server is reachable only by the host's own
   pages, and only over loopback (§6.2).

---

## 2. Package format

### 2.1 Folder layout

```text
<app-id>/
  app.json          # or manifest.json
  index.html        # the entry document
  app.js  style.css # any other assets (served/loaded relative to the folder)
  server.js         # OPTIONAL host-side Node module (served apps only — see §5.1)
```

### 2.2 Manifest

`app.json` (preferred) or `manifest.json`, UTF-8 JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "my-app",
  "name": "My App",
  "entry": "index.html",
  "served": false,
  "options": [
    { "key": "host",  "label": "Server URL", "type": "text" },
    { "key": "token", "label": "API token",  "type": "secret", "serverOnly": true }
  ],
  "server": "server.js",
  "proxy": { "methods": ["GET"], "verifySslOption": "verifySsl", "allow": [{ "option": "host" }] }
}
```

(This example is illustrative, composing every field in one manifest — no single real app
uses all of them at once. See `apps/apps.json` or any `community-apps/` folder for real ones.)

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **yes** | Stable identifier. MUST match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`. Folder name SHOULD equal it. |
| `name` | string | no | Display name. Defaults to `id`. |
| `entry` (alias `file`) | string | **yes** | Relative path to the entry document. MUST pass the safe-path rule (§2.4). |
| `served` | bool | no | `false` = static `file://`; `true` = served over loopback HTTP. Default `false`. |
| `options` | array | no | User-set option descriptors (§2.5). Default `[]`. |
| `server` | string | served only | Relative path to a host-side Node module (§5.1). Triggers the exec-code warning on import. |
| `proxy` | object | served only | Outbound-fetch allow-list for the app's page (§5.2). |
| `oauth` | object | served only | Per-app OAuth registration for cloud-account access (§5.4). |
| `grid` | object | served only | OPTIONAL embedded editable tile grid carried by the app: `{ cols, rows, defaults }` (column/row count + default tile contents). MAY be ignored by a host that doesn't support in-app grids. |
| `hideGridInEditor` | bool | no | When `true`, the editor hides this app's embedded-grid controls (the app manages its own layout). Default `false`. |
| `dev` | bool | no | Marks the app as developer-only; a conforming host MAY hide it from the normal app picker behind a "show developer apps" toggle. Purely a discoverability hint — carries no security meaning. |

A host MUST ignore unknown manifest keys (forward compatibility).

### 2.3 `id` rules

`id` MUST match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` (lowercase alphanumeric, `_`, `-`; not starting with
`-`/`_`). A folder whose manifest `id` is missing or invalid MUST be skipped, not loaded.

### 2.4 Safe-path rule (entry, server, served files)

Any manifest-supplied relative path, and any served request path, MUST be rejected if, after
normalizing `\` → `/`, it:

- contains `..`, or
- starts with `/`, or
- is absolute, or
- carries a scheme/drive prefix (matches `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]*:`).

Resolved paths MUST additionally be confirmed to stay inside the app root (string-prefix check
against `root + path.sep`). This is the core of §6.1.

### 2.5 Option descriptors

Each entry of `options` describes one user-configurable value the editor renders:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | Option name; becomes the URL param / hash key and the `options` map key. |
| `label` | Editor label. |
| `type` | `text` \| `bool` \| `secret` \| `select` \| (host-defined extras). `bool` is coerced to a real boolean. |
| `default` | Default value when unset. |
| `choices` | **Required for `type: "select"`.** Array of `[value, label]` pairs the editor renders as a dropdown. |
| `help` | Optional help text shown under the field in the editor. |
| `showIf` | Optional conditional visibility: `{ key, value }` — this field only renders when the option named `key` currently equals `value`. Lets an option's own fields hide/show based on a sibling (e.g. a set of manual fields that only appear when a "use defaults" toggle is off). |
| `serverOnly` | If `true`, the value is **never** placed in the page URL — it reaches the app only via the host-side server adapter / `/app-config` (§5.3). |

`type: "secret"` values MUST be stored encrypted at rest and MUST NOT appear in the page URL;
they are delivered only through the same-origin config route (§5.3).

---

## 3. Storage and discovery

### 3.1 Where apps live

Drop-in apps MUST be discovered **only** from a per-user data folder, never the install dir:

```
%APPDATA%\open-quake\apps\        (default)
%LOCALAPPDATA%\open-quake\apps\   (when the user selects the "localappdata" location)
```

The location is a host setting (`settings.dropInLocation`: unset/`appdata` → `%APPDATA%`,
`localappdata` → `%LOCALAPPDATA%`). The host MUST create this folder on startup and import into
it. Non-Windows hosts SHOULD use the platform-equivalent per-user data dir (e.g.
`~/.config/open-quake/apps`).

> Rationale: the install directory is overwritten on update. Bundled first-party apps may ship
> in the install tree, but **user** drop-ins must survive updates, so they live in user data.

### 3.2 Scan algorithm

For each immediate subdirectory of the apps folder:

1. Read `app.json` or `manifest.json`; skip the folder if neither parses.
2. Validate `id` (§2.3) and `entry` (§2.4); skip on failure (log a one-time warning).
3. **Dedup by `id`, first registration wins.** Bundled apps are registered before drop-ins, so a
   drop-in MUST NOT shadow a bundled app of the same `id`.
4. If `served`, register the app's root (+ optional `proxy`, `server`) with the loopback server.

Discovery is recomputed on demand (and after any import/delete), so newly added folders appear
without a restart.

---

## 4. Runtime modes

### 4.1 Static (`served: false`)

The host loads the entry document directly via `file://`. Because a `file://` URL drops its
query string, options are passed in the **hash**:

```
file:///…/<app-id>/index.html#host=example.com&theme=dark&_grid=1
```

Only non-secret, non-`serverOnly` options are included. The host MAY append its own hash params
(e.g. theme, a `_grid=1` hint when a native button strip is shown). Best for self-contained
HTML/CSS/JS with no live host data.

### 4.2 Served (`served: true`)

The host serves the app folder over a loopback HTTP server and navigates the panel to it.
Options are normal query params (secrets/`serverOnly` excluded):

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/apps/<app-id>/<entry>?host=example.com&theme=dark
```

`<port>` is ephemeral — the app MUST use **relative** URLs / same-origin `fetch`, never a
hard-coded port. Use served mode when the app needs same-origin `fetch`, a secure context
(e.g. microphone), or host-side helpers (§5).

### 4.3 Served static files

`GET /apps/<app-id>/<relative-path>` serves files from the app root, subject to §2.4
containment. Unknown app id or escaping path → `404`/`403`.

---

## 5. Host-side extensions (served apps only)

### 5.1 Server module (`server`)

`server` names a Node module inside the app folder that the host `require`s on first use (only
if the resolved path is inside the app root). It MUST export:

```js
exports.handle = async function (action, context) {
  // context = { appId, query, options }
  //   appId   : string  — this app's id
  //   query   : object  — parsed query params of the /app-api/<action> request
  //   options : object  — the app's resolved options (incl. secrets and serverOnly)
  // return a JSON-serializable value; { ok: false, error: 'unknown action' } -> HTTP 400
  if (action === 'feed') return { ok: true, items: await loadFeed(options.host) };
  return { ok: false, error: 'unknown action' };
};
```

The page calls it with `fetch('/app-api/<action>?…')`. The host resolves the **requesting app
id from the `Referer`** (it MUST be one of our own `/apps/<id>/…` pages), so an app can only
reach its own server module. Exceptions become HTTP 500 `{ ok:false, error }`.

If no server module is present, the host still answers a built-in `/app-api/open?url=…` action
that opens an `http(s)` URL in the user's external browser (host's `openExternal`). A fork MAY
offer additional built-in actions but MUST keep them side-effect-safe and same-origin-gated.

### 5.2 Outbound proxy (`proxy`)

Served apps cannot fetch arbitrary cross-origin URLs from the page. To reach an allowed remote,
the page calls `GET /app-proxy?url=<encoded>`; the host fetches server-side and returns the
body. The manifest `proxy` block governs what's allowed:

| `proxy` key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `methods` | Allowed methods. The reference host proxies **GET only**; a block that excludes `GET` is denied. |
| `allow` | Array of allow-rules (below). Empty/absent ⇒ nothing is proxied. |
| `verifySslOption` | Name of a `bool` option; when the user sets it `false`, TLS verification is skipped for this app's proxy fetches (for self-signed LAN hosts). |

Allow-rules:

- `{ "option": "host" }` — allow requests whose origin+path are under the URL the user stored in
  option `host`. This is how an app reaches its **configured** server, **including private/LAN
  addresses**.
- `{ "pattern": "<regex>" }` — allow requests whose full URL matches the regex, **but
  private/loopback/LAN hosts are always blocked for pattern rules** (anti-SSRF). Use this only
  for fixed public endpoints.

The reference proxy also enforces: `http`/`https` only, ≤ 5 MB response, 12 s timeout, ≤ 3
redirects. A conforming host MUST keep the private-host block on `pattern` rules and the
per-app `Referer` check.

`GET /app-proxy/config` returns the requesting app's resolved config (same data as §5.3) for an
app that needs its options server-trip-free.

### 5.3 Secret / server-only delivery (`/app-config`)

`GET /app-config?app=<id>` returns `{ app, options }` with the app's **fully resolved** options
— including `secret` and `serverOnly` values and `bool` coercion. This route is **same-origin
gated** (§6.2), so only the host's own served page can read it. This is the only channel by
which secrets reach a served app; they are never in the URL.

### 5.4 Per-app OAuth (`oauth`)

Drop-in apps that need access to a user's cloud account (Microsoft Graph, GitHub, Google, etc.)
MUST declare their own OAuth app registration in the manifest. They **cannot** access the host's
system-level OAuth credentials, which belong exclusively to the host's built-in features.

```json
{
  "oauth": {
    "provider": "microsoft",
    "clientId": "your-own-azure-app-client-id",
    "scopes": ["User.Read", "offline_access"]
  }
}
```

| `oauth` key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | **yes** | Provider id: `microsoft`, `github`, or `google`. |
| `clientId` | **yes** | The app's own OAuth client id (registered in the provider's developer portal). |
| `scopes` | no | Default scopes requested. The page may request additional scopes at runtime. |

**Token isolation.** Tokens obtained for one drop-in app are stored under that app's id and are
never accessible to other apps or to the host's built-in features.

**User approval.** The first time an app triggers `GET /api/oauth-connect`, the host MUST
show a system-level approval dialog naming the app and provider before opening the browser.
Subsequent requests reuse the stored approval.

**Page API.** The served page calls the same routes used by built-in pages:

- `GET /api/oauth-tokens.json?provider=<id>&scopes=<list>` — returns `{ ok, accessToken, scope, … }` or `{ ok:false, error, code }`. The host routes this to the app's own token store.
- `GET /api/oauth-connect?provider=<id>&scopes=<list>` — triggers the OAuth consent flow (shows the approval dialog on first use, then opens the browser).

**No shared credentials.** An app MUST NOT omit `oauth.clientId` and rely on the host to supply
one. A conforming host MUST reject token and connect requests from drop-in apps that have no
`oauth` declaration in their manifest.

---

## 6. Security model (normative)

A conforming host MUST implement all of the following.

### 6.1 Path containment

Every manifest path and every served request path passes §2.4, **and** the resolved absolute
path is verified to equal the app root or start with `root + separator`. Reject with `403`
otherwise. Applies to: `entry`, `server`, and all `/apps/<id>/…` requests.

### 6.2 Loopback isolation

The served server binds `127.0.0.1` only, and:

- **Host-header check (anti-DNS-rebinding):** every request whose `Host` is not
  `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>` is rejected `403`. Browsers set `Host` from the URL
  and page JS cannot forge it, so this defeats rebinding.
- **Same-origin gate:** all **side-effecting, live-data, and secret** routes (`/app-config`,
  `/app-proxy`, `/app-proxy/config`, `/app-api/*`, plus host routes like launch/media/metrics)
  require `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` (with an `Origin`-based fallback that fails closed). Only
  the static page + asset routes are reachable by top-level navigation.

### 6.3 Informed consent for host code (import warning)

On import, before installing, the host MUST detect whether the package can run code on the host
and, if so, warn the user and require explicit confirmation. "Can run host code" means:

- the manifest declares a `server` module, **or**
- the folder bundles an executable/script by extension: `.exe .dll .com .scr .msi .bat .cmd
  .ps1 .psm1 .vbs .vbe .wsf .wsh .jar .sh .cpl` (recursively).

Client-side `.js` runs sandboxed in the webview and is **not** flagged. A server module or
native binary runs with the **full privileges of the host process** — there is no sandbox. The
warning text SHOULD make the trust decision explicit (e.g. *"This drop-in app contains
executable code; only import it if you trust the source."*).

### 6.4 Content-Security-Policy

Served responses carry a restrictive CSP and `Cache-Control: no-store`. A fork SHOULD keep a CSP
that confines app pages to same-origin resources.

---

## 7. Manager operations (reference)

The editor's **Settings → Drop-In Apps** tab is backed by these host operations. A fork MAY
expose them however it likes; the **behaviors** matter, not the transport.

| Operation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **list** | Enumerate installed drop-in apps: `{ id, name, served, hasServer, managed }`. `managed` = lives in the user-data dir (only those can be exported/deleted). |
| **import(zip, forceId?, confirmExec?)** | Unzip to a temp dir; locate the app root (`findAppRoot`: manifest at top level or in a single subfolder); run the §6.3 exec check (unless `confirmExec`); on id conflict return a rename prompt (retry with `forceId`); rewrite `manifest.id` if renamed; move into `<apps>/<id>`. |
| **export(id)** | Zip the app folder to a user-chosen path (managed apps only). |
| **delete(id)** | Remove the app folder — **only** if it resolves inside the user-data dir. |
| **refresh** | Recompute discovery (also done automatically after import/delete). |
| **getInfo / setLocation** | Read/switch the storage location (§3.1); switching affects where new imports land. |

Import results are a tagged union: `{ ok:true, id, name }` · `{ ok:false, warnExec:true, id,
server }` (needs `confirmExec`) · `{ ok:false, conflict:true, id }` (needs `forceId`) ·
`{ ok:false, error }`.

Reference IPC channel names (renderer → main): `listDropInApps`, `pickZip`,
`importDropInApp(zipPath, forceId, confirmExec)`, `exportDropInApp(id)`, `deleteDropInApp(id)`,
`getDropInInfo`, `setDropInLocation(loc)`, `openExternal(url)`.

The reference implementation zips/unzips via Windows `Expand-Archive` / `Compress-Archive` (no
extra dependency); a cross-platform fork SHOULD substitute a portable zip library.

---

## 8. Cross-fork compatibility contract

For an app authored against one fork to install and run on another, all conforming hosts MUST
agree on:

1. The manifest schema and field semantics (§2), including `id`/path rules.
2. Static option delivery via URL **hash**; served option delivery via **query**; secrets and
   `serverOnly` excluded from both (§4, §5.3).
3. The served route shape: `/apps/<id>/<entry>`, `/app-config?app=<id>`, `/app-proxy?url=…`,
   `/app-proxy/config`, `/app-api/<action>`.
4. The server-module contract: `exports.handle(action, { appId, query, options })` (§5.1).
5. The proxy allow-rule semantics and the private-host block on `pattern` rules (§5.2).

Hosts MAY add fields/routes/option types beyond these; apps relying on extensions are
host-specific and SHOULD degrade gracefully where the extension is absent.
