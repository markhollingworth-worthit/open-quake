## For developers

Building your own drop-in app? The [`skills/`](skills) folder holds
Claude Code skills you can drop into your `.claude/skills/` to get
AI-assisted scaffolding and authoring help. Today:

- [`open-quake-drop-in-app`](skills/open-quake-drop-in-app) — guides
  Claude through the manifest schema, served vs. file modes, options,
  `/app-proxy`, `/app-api`, and the host/runtime boundary so it stays
  inside `apps/<app-id>/` and doesn't touch platform code.
