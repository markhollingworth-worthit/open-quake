# Open Quake Drop-In App

Use this skill when creating or changing standalone drop-in apps in the open-quake repo.

## Contract

- Treat `apps/<app-id>/` as the app boundary.
- A normal app is self-contained with `app.json`, `index.html`, optional `style.css`, optional `app.js`, optional local assets, and optional `server.js` only when using the generic app server capability.
- Keep `app.json.id` stable, lowercase, and unique. Prefer matching the folder name for new apps.
- During migration, preserve an existing app id even if the folder name differs.
- Do not edit host/runtime files for a normal app.
- Treat changes to app discovery, serving, editor behavior, IPC, packaging, local server behavior, or build files as platform work, not app work.
- Use relative asset URLs in HTML, such as `style.css` and `app.js`.

## Standalone Structure

For a new app, create:

```text
apps/<app-id>/
  app.json
  index.html
  style.css
  app.js
```

Minimal `app.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "<app-id>",
  "name": "<App Name>",
  "entry": "index.html",
  "options": []
}
```

Use `"served": true` when the app needs `/app-proxy`, `/app-api`, `/apptiles`, `/launch`, or other same-origin local server features.

# Repository Rules

- Future requests to add, create, or scaffold a normal drop-in app should only edit files under `apps/<app-id>/`.
- Do not touch `app/main.js`, `app/sysserver.js`, `app/config.html`, packaging, or runtime code for a normal app request unless the user explicitly asks to change the platform.

## Workflow

1. Read `Repository Rules` first and follow its drop-in app rules.
2. Inspect a nearby existing app, `apps/test-app`, before creating patterns.
3. Create or edit only the app folder unless the user explicitly asks for platform work.
4. Keep app options in `app.json`; read them from `location.search` for served apps or `location.hash` for file apps, matching the host loader behavior.
5. Build the actual app screen first; avoid landing pages for tool/dashboard apps.
6. Validate JSON manifests and syntax-check JavaScript with `node --check` when possible.

## Served Apps

- Use `"served": true` when the app needs same-origin calls to the local open-quake server, shared app tile APIs, or host-provided generic APIs.
- Served drop-ins load at `/apps/<id>/<entry>` on the local server.
- Use relative asset paths such as `style.css` and `app.js`.

## Options

- Define app options in `app.json`.
- For served apps, non-server-only options are encoded into `location.search`.
- For file apps, options are encoded into `location.hash`.
- Mark sensitive or host-only values with `"serverOnly": true`; access those through `/app-proxy/config` or an app-local `server.js` handler.
- Use `"type": "secret"` for passwords/API keys.

Example:

```json
{
  "key": "apiKey",
  "label": "API key",
  "type": "secret",
  "default": "",
  "serverOnly": true
}
```

## Existing Generic Capabilities

Use existing generic capabilities from `app.json`; do not modify host/runtime files during normal app scaffolding.

For reusable API access, prefer a generic capability instead of app-specific hooks:

- App declares proxy permissions in `app.json`.
- Host exposes a stable generic endpoint for allowed requests.
- Host enforces origin/pattern allowlists and method limits.
- Host keeps secrets out of logs and responses.
- Host supports self-signed TLS only through explicit per-app/per-request opt-in.

Current proxy contract:

- Add `"served": true` to apps that need the proxy.
- Add an `app.json` `proxy` block, for example:

```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "verifySslOption": "verifySsl",
    "allow": [{ "option": "host" }]
  }
}
```

- Use `GET /app-proxy/config` to read active app options, including server-only options.
- Use `GET /app-proxy?url=<encoded-url>` to fetch an allowed upstream URL.

For app-local server code, declare `"server": "server.js"` and export `handle(action, context)`.

```js
'use strict';

async function handle(action, context) {
  if (action === 'summary') return { ok: true };
  return { ok: false, error: 'unknown action' };
}

module.exports = { handle };
```

The active app can call `GET /app-api/<action>`. Keep integration-specific server code inside the app folder.

Avoid adding routes named for a single integration, such as `/api/qnap/...`, unless the user asks for a built-in one-off integration.

## Platform Work

Only touch host/runtime code when the user explicitly asks to change the platform itself.

Platform files include app discovery, serving, editor behavior, IPC, packaging, build files, and local server behavior. When platform work is explicitly requested, prefer generic, reusable capabilities over app-specific hooks.

## Validation

- Parse edited JSON: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('apps/<app-id>/app.json','utf8'))"`.
- Check JavaScript: `node --check apps/<app-id>/app.js` and `node --check apps/<app-id>/server.js` when present.
- Search for accidental host hooks: `rg -n "<app-id>|/api/<app-id>" app apps`.
- Confirm the app uses relative asset paths and no absolute legacy paths.

## QNAP Lesson

QNAP direct browser fetch can fail on TLS or CORS. If live LAN APIs must work from a drop-in app, use a generic host capability or app-local `server.js` rather than a specific host route.
